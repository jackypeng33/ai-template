## BOOTH Rap MVP

- Scope: `docs/RAPVIDEO-MVP-SPEC.md`; operations: `docs/RAPVIDEO-MVP-IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- Independent English-only `/rap`, `/rap/policy`, admin-only `/rap/manage`; core code in `features/rap`, `lib/rap`, `app/api/rap` and `app/api/cron/rap-video`.
- Dedicated `rap_*` tables. Video purchases do not change general credits. Keep payment/initial job atomic, order locks before task locks, and idempotent failure replacement/retry records.
- User explicitly requested no video API calls. Keep generation, checkout, quality and music-rights flags OFF. A KIE key is not authorization to generate.
- `/api/rap/paypal/webhook` uses its own `RAP_PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`. Never mix Webhook IDs across registered URLs.
- Private customer media stays outside `public/`; production needs a private bucket. Concept art and reference soundtrack under `public/rap` are not proof of generated-video quality.
- PostgreSQL tests opt in via dedicated `RAP_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, never production credentials.

This file gives coding agents an accurate working map for this repository.

## What This Repo Is

`sistine-starter-vibe-to-production` is a production-oriented AI SaaS starter for teaching AI coding and launching commercial AI products quickly.

The repo already includes:

- Better Auth email/password auth plus Google OAuth UI
- Credit-based billing with Creem subscriptions and one-time packs
- Volcano Engine integrations for chat, image generation, and video generation
- Admin screens for users, subscriptions, and credit operations
- Marketing pages, blog, docs-style messaging, and legal pages
- `next-intl` localization for English and Chinese

Optimize changes for two goals at the same time:

1. Keep the starter reusable for buyers and students.
2. Keep production data flows correct for auth, billing, credits, and generation history.

## Ground Rules

- Use `pnpm` for installs and scripts. `package-lock.json` exists, but `package.json` declares `pnpm` as the package manager.
- Prefer accurate docs over aspirational docs. If the code and docs disagree, fix the docs or fix the code.
- Do not reintroduce remote demo asset dependencies that the app can serve locally.
- Treat billing, credits, subscriptions, and auth as consistency-sensitive systems. Avoid "UI-only" updates that leave DB state drifting.

## Daily Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:webpack
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:studio
pnpm admin:setup
pnpm generate:blog-manifest
```

Notes:

- `pnpm dev` runs `scripts/run-dev.mjs`, which launches Next dev with a cleaned environment and syncs the Fumadocs stylesheet first. It does not regenerate the blog manifest.
- `pnpm dev:webpack` is the safe fallback if Turbopack is too heavy on the current machine.
- `pnpm build` runs both `sync:fumadocs-style` and `generate:blog-manifest` before building.
- If you add, rename, or remove blog posts, regenerate the blog manifest before committing.

## Environment Variables

Use `.env.example` as the source of truth for required names.

The important groups are:

- Database: `DATABASE_URL`
- Auth: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- Optional Google auth: `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`
- AI: `VOLCANO_ENGINE_API_KEY`, `VOLCANO_ENGINE_API_URL`
- Payments: `CREEM_API_KEY`, `CREEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Email: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- App URL: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- Cron auth: `CRON_SECRET` or `CRON_JOBS_USERNAME` + `CRON_JOBS_PASSWORD`
- Storage: `STORAGE_*`

## Core Product Invariants

### 1. Auth and signup

- Better Auth is configured in `lib/auth.ts`.
- New signups receive a 300 credit registration bonus in the auth hook.
- If you change signup behavior, preserve the registration bonus flow unless the product decision explicitly changes it.
- Google OAuth is optional now. It is enabled only when both `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` are present.
- The login and signup forms should stay in sync with the server config: if the provider is disabled, the Google button should not render.

### 2. Credits and ledger integrity

- `user.credits` is the fast balance.
- `credit_ledger` is the audit trail.
- Any credit mutation should update both, ideally in one transaction.
- Chat currently costs 10 credits, image generation 20 credits, and video generation 50 credits.
- Paid AI routes use `createCreditCompensation(...)` to refund credits if provider work fails after deduction. Preserve that pattern.

### 3. Billing and subscriptions

- Enable PayPal packs with `PAYPAL_ENABLED` and matching environment credentials, merchant ID and webhook ID. Enable subscriptions separately with `PAYPAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED` and four `PAYPAL_PLAN_*` IDs.
- In PayPal subscription mode, NEW recurring checkouts use PayPal exclusively (Creem checkout rejects new subscriptions). Existing Creem renewals continue. Do not create overlapping provider subscriptions or automatically migrate existing subscribers.
- PayPal plans must be active, fixed USD, one infinite regular monthly/yearly cycle, no trials/taxes/setup/shipping/quantity overrides, and `auto_bill_outstanding=false`.
- `subscription.currentPeriodEnd` is paid-through for PayPal; `nextBillingAt` is informational. Activation alone does not grant credits or a paid plan. Canceled/suspended subscriptions retain paid rights until their paid-through date.
- PayPal annual grants live in `subscription_credit_grant`, one set per payment. Never replace previous paid cycles with a new year's schedule. Cancellation preserves paid installments; refund/reversal review freezes them.
- The existing authenticated subscription-grants cron also processes PayPal grants, refreshes expired plan labels and reconciles five subscriptions per call using overlapping bounded transaction windows. Keep the per-user lock order and transaction-ID idempotency.
- PayPal capture responses and verified webhooks share `settlePayPalCapture`. Never grant credits from return URL parameters or approval alone.
- PayPal payment IDs are namespaced as `paypal:<captureId>`; `billing_order` snapshots pricing/credits. Keep its row lock and accounting writes in one transaction.
- `payment_event` retains failed notifications for replay. Refund/reversal events require manual review; automatic refund debits are not implemented. See `content/docs/payments/paypal.mdx` and `content/docs/payments/paypal-subscriptions.mdx`.
- Creem retains its existing implementation; its older transaction limitations are not repaired by the PayPal path.

- Plan keys and pack keys only come from `constants/billing.ts`.
- Creem webhook processing lives in `app/api/payments/creem/webhook/route.ts`.
- Annual plans use `subscription_credit_schedule` installments and are granted by `app/api/cron/subscription-grants/route.ts`.
- If you touch subscription logic, keep these records aligned:
  `user.planKey`, `payment`, `subscription`, `credit_ledger`, and `subscription_credit_schedule`.
- The admin subscription mutation endpoint is intentionally simple right now and only updates `user.planKey`. Do not assume that is sufficient for a real subscription migration.

### 4. AI generation flows

- Chat route: `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Image route: `app/api/image/generate/route.ts`
- Video route: `app/api/video/generate/route.ts`
- Video status route: `app/api/video/status/route.ts`

Important behavior:

- Image generation is currently image-to-image only. The route requires both `prompt` and `imageUrl`.
- Video generation supports prompt-only or image-to-video input.
- Generation history is persisted in `generation_history`.
- If provider output is mirrored into R2 and that upload fails, the code often falls back to the provider URL instead of hard-failing.

### 5. Upload and storage behavior

- User uploads enter through `app/api/upload/image/route.ts`.
- Provider-generated media mirroring uses `lib/r2-storage.ts`.
- If storage is not configured:
  - upload route may return a data URL for testing
  - provider result mirroring may return the original provider URL
- Be careful when changing this behavior because demos and tests rely on graceful fallbacks.

### 6. i18n

- Locales are defined in `i18n.config.ts`.
- Locale routing is handled by `proxy.ts`.
- Translation loading is in `lib/i18n.ts`.
- The app URL strategy is `as-needed`, so default-locale routes use `/docs`, `/pricing`, etc. rather than `/en/...`.
- When changing user-facing copy, update both English and Chinese unless the task explicitly says otherwise.
- If you change SEO copy, update `messages/seo.en.json` and `messages/seo.zh.json` too.

### 7. Docs site

- The product ships an integrated docs site at `/docs` and `/zh/docs`.
- Docs content lives in `content/docs/**/*.mdx`.
- Docs routing and rendering live in `app/[locale]/docs/*`.
- `lib/source.ts` reads from generated `.source/*` output created by `fumadocs-mdx`.
- `public/fumadocs-style.css` is generated. Do not hand-edit it; update the sync script or upstream dependency instead.

## Current Known Gotchas

- Some API routes still emit known dynamic server usage warnings during `pnpm build`, especially:
  - `/api/auth/verify-email`
  - `/api/auth/verify-reset-token`
  - `/api/newsletter/unsubscribe`
  - `/api/user/admin-status`
  - `/api/user/credits/history`
- If you touch routes that read `request.url`, `headers`, cookies, or auth state, consider explicitly marking them dynamic.
- `app/api/upload/simple/route.ts` is demo-oriented and not the main production upload path.
- Demo assets were intentionally localized into `public/starter`. Do not switch them back to `offerget` or other third-party runtime URLs.
- Fumadocs ships Tailwind v4-oriented CSS, so the repo deliberately syncs that stylesheet into `public/` and loads it via `<link>` to avoid Tailwind v3/PostCSS conflicts.
- Turbopack can still feel heavy on some macOS setups. Prefer `pnpm dev:webpack` if local development becomes sluggish.

## Testing Expectations

Run the smallest useful set, but do verify your changes:

- `pnpm lint`:
  run for any UI, route, config, or translation change
- `pnpm test`:
  run for logic changes in billing, auth, credits, email, sessions, or utilities
- `pnpm build`:
  run when touching routing, middleware, auth, next config, env-sensitive code, or server routes

Current test coverage is concentrated in:

- `tests/components/*`
- `tests/constants/*`
- `tests/lib/*`

If you change billing, email, auth, or credit logic, add or update tests in `tests/lib`.

## Contributor Advice By Area

### Marketing and docs

- Keep README, `AGENTS.md`, and `.env.example` aligned with the actual code.
- Use real repo paths in docs. Do not reference missing files or imaginary folders.
- If you update product positioning, double-check marketing copy in both locales.

### Admin features

- Treat admin mutations as high-risk.
- Changing a user balance is not the same thing as changing the ledger.
- Changing a plan label is not the same thing as changing a subscription state.

### Billing

- Never invent plan keys.
- Never grant credits outside the ledger path unless you are intentionally repairing historical data.
- Preserve webhook idempotency.

### Generated content and assets

- Blog MDX is source content.
- `lib/blog-manifest.generated.ts` is derived output.
- `public/starter` contains committed local demo assets.
- `.asset-sources/starter-demo` contains source stills for the committed local demo videos.

## Preferred Change Style

- Make the smallest change that preserves product truth.
- Favor explicit invariants over convenience.
- If a route has environment-dependent fallbacks, document that behavior in code comments when you change it.
- If you discover a mismatch between UI copy, README, and code, fix the mismatch rather than leaving "TODO" drift behind.

## Before You Finish

Before wrapping a task, check:

1. Did you keep credits, billing, and subscription state internally consistent?
2. Did you update both locales if user-facing copy changed?
3. Did you avoid reintroducing external runtime demo assets?
4. Did you run the right validation commands for the area you touched?
5. Did you leave generated files and docs in sync with the codebase?
